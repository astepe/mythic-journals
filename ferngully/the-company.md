# The Company

Four knights, bound by oath and sent forth by their seer to seek out Kernick at Fen. They are strange, flawed, and sworn to the realm whether it wants them or not.

## Nancy Prances the Saddle Knight

The strongest and most capable of the company — a natural athlete, a born climber, and a diplomat when the moment calls for it. Nancy's gender shifts like weather, sometimes a man and sometimes a woman, and neither state invites comment. They speak to horses, a rare gift that sets them apart even among knights.

Nancy was the one who climbed the great tree, who cut the twig that would not stop growing, and who first spotted the ancient dueling ground from the canopy. In Fen, it was Nancy who smoothed over Vivian's disgrace in the square, turning a sour evening into celebration. Nancy spent a night with a man called Roose — who turned out to be Kernick, the ruler of Fen, in disguise.

Nancy carries an axe that felled the boneborn in a single stroke.

**Weapon:** Axe

## Vivian the Moat Knight

Vivian is intense, fixated, and prone to episodes of deep absorption — she will crouch over a strange bone or an unusual patch of soil and lose herself entirely, theorizing aloud while the world moves on around her. She gains a sense of protection when partially submerged in water, and seeks it instinctively.

Her steed refuses to follow her commands. It may trust Nancy — who has a way with horses — and can be bribed with sugar cubes, but Vivian's relationship with the animal remains fraught.

In Fern Gully, Vivian drove a nail into the hungering tree and watched the bark consume it whole. In Fen, she leapt into the town fountain with her sword drawn and frightened two children, earning a sharp rebuke from a local man. She is still finding her way within the oath.

**Weapon:** Sword, shovel

## Leonard the Tankard Knight

Leonard is perpetually drunk, though no one has ever seen him drink. The source of his intoxication is a mystery. His drunkenness, strangely, serves him — in the fight against the boneborn, his stumbling state lent him an unpredictable guard that turned aside a lethal lunge.

He is brave and physical. He hugged the hungering tree and listened to it grow. He entered the dark tunnel without hesitation. After the boneborn fell, he took a femur from the remains — a trophy he still carries.

In Fen, Leonard worked the tavern, coaxing a scholar into revealing talk of raids sanctioned by the council at Barrow on a well near the holding — a site a local religious group considers holy.

**Weapon:** Unknown (fights alongside Nancy)

## Edgar Allen Joe the Riddle Knight

Charismatic and strangely magnetic, Edgar Allen Joe can draw secrets from people given enough time and conversation.

He is fond of riddles — muttering them to himself when idle, reciting them in moments of quiet. He remained behind with Vivian when Nancy and Leonard entered the tree tunnel, content to sit and speak his puzzles into the empty air.

In the tavern at Fen, it was Edgar who thought to ask what wine Kernick preferred — chrysanthemum — a small detail that would later help unravel the ruler's disguise.

**Weapon:** Unknown
