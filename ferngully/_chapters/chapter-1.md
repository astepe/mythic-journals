## The Purple Field

The company entered Fern Gully from the east, their oath-road leading them toward the holding of Fen and a knight called Kernick who would set them on their path. The seer had spoken. They obeyed.

The first thing they found was beauty — a sweeping field of fiddle leaf ferns, enormous and purple, their leaves shaped like the heads of sleeping giants. But one fern stood apart from the rest. Its leaves were blackened and sloughing off in wet strips. The soil beneath it was soft and warm, and from the earth, bones were growing.

Not buried. *Growing.*

Vivian knelt at the base of the rotting fern and fell into a kind of trance, turning bones over in her hands, muttering theories about what force could drive dead matter upward through living roots. Nancy reached in and touched one. It was warm, as though freshly pulled from a body. The bones were misshapen — no creature any of them could name.

They left the fern behind, but the wrongness of it followed them.

## The Hungering Tree

To the west they found a tree unlike any other. Its branches twisted in spirals of black and blue, reaching high into the pale sky. Leonard embraced the trunk and pressed his ear against the bark. Inside, he could hear it — a crackling, constant sound. The tree was growing, even now, even as they watched.

Nancy climbed. She was strong enough to reach the upper boughs, hundreds of feet up, where the air thinned and the canopy swayed. She cut a twig free with her blade. Before her eyes, the severed twig began to sprout — new growth pushing outward within moments. She pocketed it for safekeeping, hoping a seer might explain it.

Vivian, ever curious, drove a nail into the trunk. The bark swallowed it whole before she could pull it free. The tree consumed it as though hungry.

From her vantage high above, Nancy could see the landscape spread out below — and just to the west, a small circular outcropping of stone. Some kind of structure, too far to make out clearly.

## The Tunnel and the Boneborn

They pressed onward and found a tree with a hollow tunnel bored through its trunk. Nancy and Leonard entered together, leaving Vivian and Edgar Allen Joe behind — Vivian to dig a protective hole in the damp earth, Edgar to mutter riddles to himself in the fading light.

Inside the tunnel, the darkness was near-total. Something moved in it. A boneborn — a creature of fused and shattered bone, airborne and shrieking.

Nancy could barely see to strike. Leonard caught the full force of a lunge, barely turning it aside at the last moment, his guard shattered by the impact. Then Nancy surged forward and brought her axe down in a single terrible arc. The boneborn burst apart into a pile of loose bone and bile.

Leonard took a femur from the heap. A trophy, or perhaps a reminder.

## The Sky Goes Dark

They made camp as night fell. When dawn came, the company looked up and understood.

The tree — the twisting, hungry tree with its black and blue branches — had grown through the night. Its canopy now stretched across the entire sky, a vast lattice of dark limbs filtering the light into a dim, grey haze. The sun was still there, somewhere, but the tree had claimed the heavens.

Enough light remained to see and travel. But the realm had changed.

## The Dueling Ground

They investigated the stone outcropping Nancy had seen from the tree. It was an ancient dueling ground — a circular arena of cracked flagstone, overgrown with moss and creeping vine. It had not seen use in centuries.

Standing there, the company felt something stir. A quiet recognition. Knights had come to this place before them, long ago, and sworn their oaths upon this same stone. The weight of that lineage settled into their bones. A place to return to, should the road wear their spirits thin.

## Fen

They reached the holding of Fen before nightfall.

The first thing they saw was the ruin — the remains of an old citadel, crumbling but untouched, sitting within the walls as though the town had simply grown around it and agreed never to disturb what lay there. Whatever history it held, the people of Fen had chosen to leave it be.

Past the ruin, the bailey opened up around a great fountain carved with figures of dancing peasantry — joyful, communal, an ode to the folk who called this place home. The air smelled of spices, sweet enough to mask something fouler beneath. Children ran through the square. A forge whirred somewhere nearby.

Vivian, upon seeing the fountain, immediately leapt into the water. She splashed about with her sword drawn, making a spectacle of herself. Two young boys nearby burst into giggles — until Vivian turned and drew her blade toward them. The laughter died. Their mother swept them up and hurried inside, shielding their eyes.

A man who had witnessed the scene approached Vivian, furious. He reminded her that knights swear oaths to *protect* this realm, not terrorize its children. The realm needed help, he said. Real help. He supposed she was new to her oath and still finding her way, but he urged her — *honor it.*

Nancy stepped in to calm things, apologizing on Vivian's behalf, explaining that the road had been long and rest was needed. Then, to turn the evening around, Nancy called for music and began to dance in the square. The people of Fen — a folk well-practiced in celebration — joined in almost at once. The mood lifted.

## Roose

During the revelry, a man called Roose appeared. He was dirty, dressed in rags, and utterly charming. He danced alongside Nancy and Vivian, laughing freely, and took a particular liking to Nancy — impressed by her strength and wit. He led them to the tavern where Leonard and Edgar Allen Joe had already settled in.

The tavern keep listed the wines — mulch, chrysanthemum, liver, and other strange brews. Edgar asked which wine Kernick preferred. Chrysanthemum, he was told. They would bring a bottle when they met with him in the morning.

Leonard, meanwhile, worked a scholar at the bar. He coaxed out talk of raids — the council at Barrow had sanctioned incursions on a well near Fen. A religious group in the holding considered the well holy, sacred and untouchable. The scholar dismissed it as nonsense. Leonard filed it away.

Nancy spent the night with Roose.

## The Mule Knight Revealed

Morning came. Roose asked Nancy, with a sheepish grin, whether the night had been as fine for her as it had been for him. Nancy deflected, flustered. Roose went on his way.

The company climbed to the keep to find Kernick, but he was absent. A startled woman in the kitchen told them the ruler preferred mornings in the town square, among his people. They went back down.

There was Roose again, lingering in the square. They asked him where Kernick was. He stiffened. Changed the subject. Talked about the party. But the company looked closer now. The dirt on his clothes seemed deliberate. His hair, beneath the grime, was perfect. And there — a purple stain on his cheek. Wine. Chrysanthemum wine.

They pressed him. Roose crumbled.

He led them into an alley, away from the townsfolk, and pulled the rags from his shoulders. Beneath was Kernick, the Mule Knight, ruler of Fen.

The knights stared. Nancy gave him a long, knowing look. Kernick offered nothing — when he was Kernick, he was fully Kernick. When he was Roose, he was fully Roose. There was no overlap, no wink, no apology.

He led them into the keep and directed them toward the nearest seer. The tree that had swallowed the sky — they needed answers. The seer would have them, or at least a thread to pull.

Kernick returned to his duties. The company prepared to set out.

In the corner of the hall, the twig Nancy had cut from the tree sat where they had left it. It was no longer a twig. It had grown into a full log, heavy and unwieldy. They would need to carry it or leave it behind — and carrying it through the wilds would be a burden on body and spirit alike.

The tree, it seemed, was still growing. Even in pieces. Even severed from itself.
