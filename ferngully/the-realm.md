## Holdings

### Fen

**Ruler:** Kernick, the Mule Knight

A holding built around the remains of an ancient ruined citadel. The ruins sit untouched within the walls — whatever history they hold, the people of Fen have chosen to leave it undisturbed. The bailey centers on a great fountain carved with dancing peasantry, and the air is thick with spices meant to mask some fouler smell beneath. A forge whirs. Children play.

The keep is a long hall with a table stretched end to end, walls hung with antlers, and shelves of esoteric wines — mulch, chrysanthemum, liver, and stranger brews still. The air inside is dense and heavy.

## Loose Threads

- **The growing bones:** Beneath a rotting fern in the purple fields, warm and misshapen bones are growing up through the soil as though alive. No one knows what creature they belong to.
- **The hungering tree:** Its canopy covers the sky. A severed twig grows into a log. A nail is consumed by its bark. What is it? What does it want?
- **The ancient dueling ground:** A circular stone arena west of the fern fields, overgrown and unused for centuries. The company felt a connection to the long line of knights who swore oaths there. A place to restore spirit.
- **The ruined citadel at Fen:** Ancient remains within the holding walls, deliberately left untouched by the townsfolk. Its history is unknown.
- **The blood well raids:** The council at Barrow has sanctioned raids on a well near Fen. A religious group in Fen considers the well a holy site. The scholar in the tavern dismissed the group's claims as nonsense.
- **Kernick's dual life:** The ruler of Fen walks among his people disguised as a commoner called Roose. When he is Roose, he is fully Roose. When he is Kernick, he is fully Kernick. Nancy spent a night with him in his Roose guise before the truth came out.
- **The twig-turned-log:** The cutting from the hungering tree has grown into a heavy log. Carrying it will burden the company's spirit. Leaving it behind means abandoning a potential clue.
