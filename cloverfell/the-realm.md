## Holdings

### Dome — Visited

**Ruler:** Berav, Vassal Mercenary

An ornate dome with a humble arena where mercenaries train and commoners spectate. Berav hosts meals at a table of silver. The company stayed here early in their journey and received warm hospitality.

**Known trouble:** Sudden famine as nearby wheat fields die off, possibly due to encroaching swamps.

### Haven — Just Arrived

The seat of power in Cloverfell. A castle concealed behind a wild, natural moat, covered in plants so thick it almost blends into the landscape. The company has just arrived but hasn't explored it yet.

### Ruined Spire — Heard Of

Berav spoke fondly of a man here who bakes bread — the "breadmaker" the company's seer told them to seek.

### Beacon — Heard Of

Known for its thriving spirit industry, producing the finest rye whisky in the realm.

## Resolved Myths

### The Sprite

It began with a fisherman. **Roose Dorka** warned the company not to trust the Lady of the Pond, even as he confessed his own otherworldly love for her. Two green pond folk fought over who she loved more — one nearly hurt Savari before being mortally wounded and carried to the water.

**Ector the Weeping Seer** gave the company conflicting guidance: do what the Lady says, but don't accept any more gifts. The Lady of the Pond had already given each knight a bucket of the purest ore.

When the company entered the swamp, she found them. **Wrundil** rose from the water calling Xanthe's name, blocking their path with enormous piles of ore — a gift, she said. Xanthe refused, not wanting to owe anyone anything. Wrundil's eyes turned black. She threatened death.

Xanthe fought. Her bolt-guisarme ripped open Wrundil's seaweed-flesh chest. Wrundil fell, dying, still begging Xanthe to take the gift. *"It's not a gift anymore. It's a burden."* Tuck Tuck delivered the mercy kill — a dagger to the heart, as gentle as possible, with a mixture of mercy and disgust. Wrundil's body decomposed into plant matter, consumed by insects and dung beetles. As she dissolved, a final whisper: *Xanthe*.

The ore was abandoned. The company was shaken. Tuck Tuck saw in Wrundil's desperate love something he craves and envied Xanthe for receiving it. Savari walked away, questioning whether they had honored their oaths. Whether there was a right answer remains unclear.

*Other myths stir beneath the realm. The company may not recognize them until they have run their course.*

## Loose Threads

Things the company has left unresolved or may wish to return to.

- **Wrundil's abandoned ore** — an enormous pile of the purest ore sits in the swamp, unguarded. Darian arrived at Haven with a cart of ore. Coincidence?
- **Wrundil's ex-lovers** — she mentioned servants who would do anything she asked. Are they still active now that she's dead?
- **The Weeping Seer's conflicting advice** — "do what she says" vs. "don't accept any more gifts." Was there a right answer? Will there be consequences?
- **Pristine's dreams** — she dreamt of a blacksmith and riches, and it came true. What else has she dreamed?
- **Pryer's tower is unguarded** — the company left. Pryer was wounded. Pristine is alone.
- **Torrin** — Pryer's brother is out there somewhere, tilting at windmills.
- **The Hawkleon** flew south but is still hunting. It preys on those who stray from the group.
- **The breadmaker** — the company's seer said to "seek the breadmaker." Berav pointed them toward a man at Ruined Spire. They haven't gone yet.
