## Holdings

### Dome — Visited

**Ruler:** Berav, Vassal Mercenary

An ornate dome with a humble arena where mercenaries train and commoners spectate. Berav hosts meals at a table of silver. The company stayed here early in their journey and received warm hospitality.

**Known trouble:** Sudden famine as nearby wheat fields die off, possibly due to encroaching swamps.

### Haven — Just Arrived

The seat of power in Cloverfell. A castle concealed behind a wild, natural moat, covered in plants so thick it almost blends into the landscape. The company has just arrived but hasn't explored it yet.

### Ruined Spire — Heard Of

Berav spoke fondly of a man here who bakes bread — the "breadmaker" the company's seer told them to seek.

### Beacon — Heard Of

Known for its thriving spirit industry, producing the finest rye whisky in the realm.

## Seers

### Ector, the Weeping Seer

**Sanctum:** A crumbling tower near the swamps east of Dome. Ector weeps constantly — not from sadness, but from some condition or compulsion the company does not understand.

Ector gave the company conflicting guidance regarding the Lady of the Pond: do what she says, but don't accept any more gifts. The company has not returned to him since.

## Loose Threads

Things the company has left unresolved or may wish to return to.

- **Wrundil's abandoned ore** — an enormous pile of the purest ore sits in the swamp, unguarded. Darian arrived at Haven with a cart of ore. Coincidence?
- **Wrundil's ex-lovers** — she mentioned servants who would do anything she asked. Are they still active now that she's dead?
- **The Weeping Seer's conflicting advice** — "do what she says" vs. "don't accept any more gifts." Was there a right answer? Will there be consequences?
- **Pristine's dreams** — she dreamt of a blacksmith and riches, and it came true. What else has she dreamed?
- **Pryer's tower is unguarded** — the company left. Pryer was wounded. Pristine is alone.
- **Torrin** — Pryer's brother is out there somewhere, tilting at windmills.
- **The Hawkleon** flew south but is still hunting. It preys on those who stray from the group.
- **The breadmaker** — the company's seer said to "seek the breadmaker." Berav pointed them toward a man at Ruined Spire. They haven't gone yet.
