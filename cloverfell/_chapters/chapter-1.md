## The Seer's Command and the Road to Dome

The company was told by their seer from the east to *"seek the breadmaker."* They set out for Dome to meet its ruler, the vassal mercenary Berav.

Along the way they encountered **Roose Dorka**, a fisherman who doesn't "care about where things are" — he's consumed by an otherworldly love for Wrundil, the Lady of the Pond. He warned the company not to trust her, and gave them directions and information about Dome. Xanthe kept her distance from him — a possible fear of water.

They also encountered angry, hairless bears fighting in the fog, but chose not to approach.

Further along the road, the company came across a crowned stag, crawling and near death. Its antlers smoldered with dying embers, still faintly burning. Upon close inspection, Xanthe noticed fragments of scales clinging to the antlers — possibly from a reptile.

## Dome: Berav's Hospitality and the Rose Incident

At Dome, the company arrived in the evening and watched mercenaries training in the humble arena. There they first encountered **Gowere** and her partner **Arcturus**.

**Berav** was warm and hospitable, serving each knight the breakfast dish they wanted the next morning. He was inviting but busy and had to leave early. He spoke fondly of Christov at the Ruined Spire and his bread — the "breadmaker" the seer had told them to seek. He also gave the company guidance on where to find the Weeping Seer, so they made the journey south.

That morning, Tuck Tuck asked Berav if he knew of Gowere. Berav said he wasn't really familiar with the name, but they could probably be found in the mess hall. There, Tuck Tuck approached Gowere with a rose. Arcturus became furious and confrontational — Tuck Tuck hadn't known Gowere was his partner. Undeterred, Tuck Tuck continued his advance. Arcturus seized the rose and handed it to Gowere himself, attempting to claim the gesture as his own.

## The Green Pond Folk

On the road south, the company found two green pond folk arguing over who Wrundil loves more. A fight broke out. One of them would have injured Savari, but she denied the damage with her feat and mortally wounded the man. The company carried his half-alive body to a nearby pond and set it in the water. The other green creature followed closely, and once the knights left, it entered the water after the body — perhaps to finish the job. Its true intentions remain unclear.

## The Weeping Seer

They found **Ector the Weeping Seer** in a large carved-out log, sobbing uncontrollably, going on about how everything is falling apart and how it's no use trying anything anymore. He offered advice in exchange for someone dealing with some of the dung beetles. Xanthe chose to kill one. Ector appreciated the darkness of that: *"Now someone understands my plight — they can feel the despair that I feel."*

He then gave the company guidance on Wrundil: do what the Lady of the Pond says, but don't accept any more gifts — conflicting advice that would prove fateful. The Lady of the Pond had previously given Savari, Tuck Tuck, and Xanthe each a bucket of the purest ore. Xanthe was primarily interested in the transactional value of the ore.
