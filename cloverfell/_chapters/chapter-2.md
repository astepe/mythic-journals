## The Death of Wrundil

The company woke in a foggy, dung-beetle-infested swamp and headed north toward Haven. They heard violent splashing — Tuck Tuck spotted a woman rising from the swamp draped in weeds and moss. She saw Xanthe and called out: *"Xanthe! Is that you?"* It was the Lady of the Pond, now revealed as **Wrundil**.

Wrundil blocked the company's path with enormous piles of the purest ore — a gift for Xanthe. Xanthe refused, not wanting to owe anyone anything. Wrundil's eyes turned black and she threatened death. Xanthe leaned into her default — violence — choosing to fight rather than negotiate or submit.

In combat, Xanthe dealt 14 damage with her bolt-guisarme, ripping open Wrundil's seaweed-flesh chest. Wrundil fell, dying, still begging Xanthe to take the gift. Xanthe refused: *"It's not a gift anymore. It's a burden."*

Tuck Tuck delivered the mercy kill — a dagger to the heart, "as gentle as possible, with a mixture of mercy and disgust." Wrundil's body decomposed rapidly into plant matter consumed by insects and dung beetles. As she dissolved, a final whisper could be heard: *Xanthe*.

### Aftermath

The ore was abandoned. The company was shaken. Tuck Tuck revealed that he identified with Wrundil's desperate need to love and be loved, and envied Xanthe for the attention. He disclosed his lack of maternal love. Savari walked away, stressed about whether they honored their oaths. There's an unresolved tension: the Weeping Seer Ector gave conflicting advice — "do what the Lady says" but also "don't accept any more gifts." The company may have been wrong to refuse Wrundil, or right, or there was no right answer.

## Pryer's Tower and Duchess Pristine

Savari discovered a path leading to a tower guarded by **Pryer**, a reluctant guard watching over **Duchess Pristine**, niece of Sir Nieolas and cousin to Melarue. Pristine is obsessed with sleeping (15 hours a day) and recording her dreams, believing *"dreams are the gateway to fate"* — advice given to her by a seer.

Pryer struck a deal with the company: guard the tower overnight in exchange for two hexits (~1 liter) of whiskey and warm hospitality. He needed to leave to search for **the Cudgel** before a creature called a **Hawkleon** finds it. The Hawkleon is a catlike bird — a fierce hunter from the east that loves to toy with its prey, singling individuals out from groups.

Pryer's brother **Torrin** is a would-be knight with delusions of grandeur — a Don Quixote figure who attacked a windmill thinking it was a horse, calls himself "Don Piote," and is obsessed with books and oaths despite not being knighted. Pryer asked the company to give Torrin "a good stern talking to" if they encounter him.

### Pristine's Dream

She dreamt of *a blacksmith* and *many riches to come*. She also heard *a cart rolling on cobblestone*. This was prophetic — both were fulfilled when the company arrived at Haven.

The company spoke with the tower's cook, who confirmed Pryer is earnest but obsessive about Hawkleons, and that Pristine is "misguided by the seers." The cook described Hawkleons as fierce hunters who love to isolate and toy with prey.

## The Ravine, the White Ox, and the Clawed Bees

While scouting, Savari found a large impassable ravine and a dying white ox with three distinctive hawk-claw gashes — likely from the Hawkleon. When she approached to help, a swarm of **clawed bees** burst from the ox. She fought them off with a blast attack and they fled.

## The Hawkleon Encounter

Traveling north toward Haven, the company spotted another white ox, this one still alive but bleeding. Tuck Tuck approached to help, and a massive ash-covered catlike bird — presumably the **Hawkleon** — swooped in, picking him up briefly and dropping him. It scattered ash across a nearby village, terrifying the cats and dogs. When the three knights grouped together, the creature backed off — it preys on isolated targets. It flew south. The company camped for the night.

## Arrival at Haven

The company arrived at Haven — a castle concealed behind a naturalistic moat covered in plants. As they entered the cobblestone streets, Xanthe heard a cart. On it: piles of ore, and driving it — a broad, scruffy-bearded man in his 50s with long black curly hair and a grim, proud look.

**It was Darian.** Xanthe's former enslaver and "mentor." The blacksmith from Pristine's dream.
