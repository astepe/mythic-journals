<h1 class="page-title">The Company</h1>
<p class="page-description">Three knights travel together, bonded by oath to the seers but divided by temperament.</p>

## Xanthe the Forge Knight

Faded eyes, nihilistic, driven to control her own fate. Enslaved from a young age by a blacksmith named Darian who used her for profit. She was bonded to him by "the worst seer." Violence has been her default mode of problem-solving, and she keeps falling back into it — she killed a helpless dung beetle at the Weeping Seer's request, and when Wrundil blocked their path with gifts and threats, Xanthe answered with her bolt-guisarme. She claims nihilism but clearly carries deep feeling beneath it. She fears water and kept her distance from the fisherman Roose Dorka.

**Weapon:** Bolt-guisarme — a halberd-like polearm with a vicious hook.

## Savari the Ring Knight

Fanatical devotion to the seers and their oaths. Daughter of failed knight Jerome and a woman named Mey-rue. She brushes her braids when deep in thought. She sees Tuck Tuck as a liability and wanted him to seek a seer for his alcoholism. When a green pond creature attacked her on the road south, she denied the damage with her feat and mortally wounded it without flinching. She was shaken by the killing of Wrundil but channeled her distress into action — scouting the land, discovering a ravine, finding a mauled white ox, and fighting off clawed bees alone. She's the group's conscience and taskmaster, but cracks are showing: she's starting to question whether the company has truly honored its oaths.

## Tuck Tuck the Coin Knight

Long-haired, suave exterior masking existential darkness. Struggles with alcoholism and a lack of maternal love, compensating with charm and female attention. The Weeping Seer's sadness triggered something in him — he kept his distance, unable to face it. He was deeply affected by Wrundil's death, seeing in her desperate love something he craves. He envied Xanthe for receiving that devotion. After the mercy kill, he wanted to be alone, said he didn't want to be with anyone. He's drinking through the journey on whiskey traded from Pryer.
