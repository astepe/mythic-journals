## From the West

Igor the Salt Knight had been dispatched by his seer in the west into this new land with a single charge: *Seek the breadmaker.* He landed in a vast field — open country, no harbour in sight — and set his eyes east toward the nearest holding, though he did not yet know its name.

As he walked he came upon a strange bush heavy with fuzzy, colourful fruit; he had never seen its like. He picked one, put it in his pocket for later, and pressed on.

## The Bears in the Fog

Before he had gone far, a band of bears emerged from the fog — disgruntled, restless. Igor had no wish to confront them, so he gave them a wide berth and made camp for the night.

He had only just settled, on the edge of sleep, when a man stumbled out of the dark: crazed, frantic, barely coherent. His name was Lionel Thaddeus, a turnip farmer, and he was terrified. He spoke of a fog, a mist that moved into towns and choked people in their sleep; it had driven him from his wits. Igor, eager to fulfil his oath and to act, decided then and there to take Lionel with him — they would make for the nearest settlement and leave at once. They set out just before nightfall.

## The Night March

The night was dark and the way unclear. Both man and knight lost spirit as they trudged east. Igor, ever faithful to his remedy, threw salt over his shoulder toward Lionel to restore him and ward off the evil of the road, but it did no such thing; Lionel only grew weaker. Igor's belief that salt could cure all had made the situation worse. They walked until morning.

## The Hut

At first light they came upon a small hut. From within they heard moaning — a man and a woman in pain. Igor knocked; there was no answer. He knocked again. Still nothing. He broke down the door.

Inside they found a husband and wife in bed: **Jago Ragge** and **Evaine Ragge**. Jago was in great pain, barely responsive, clinging to some manner of sickness medication, while Evaine was desperate for help though stunned — and not a little alarmed — that a knight had burst through the door to give it. Lionel recognized the name Ragge. Evaine told them that their daughter **Tresara Ragge** had gone out to Sunken Spire to find medicines for her father and mother, so Igor and Lionel agreed to press on to Sunken Spire, to find Tresara and learn what they could of the sickness and the fog.

## The Invasive Apple

On the road Lionel was hungry. Igor pulled out the fruit he had picked from the strange bush and handed it to him. Lionel went rigid. He knew that apple — it was one of the invasive apples that had been plaguing his fields, a strain spread by **Goyon the Apple Splicer**, gone badly out of hand. In nearby realms the problem was worse; here, Lionel had taken it upon himself to eradicate the bushes wherever he found them, and he had been diligent. Now a knight had just handed him one like a gift. They continued on.

## The Horse in the Mud

Later they came upon a field of half-dead and dying soldiers sinking into the mud. Among them stood a horse by its master, who had been slain and was deep in the mire — the horse trying to pull him out, to bring him back, grieving and desperate. Igor had a way with beasts; in time he soothed the horse and led it away from its dead master. He had no need of a second mount himself, and Lionel had been on the road with him for more than a day and had none, so Igor gave the horse to Lionel.

## Sunken Spire

With the horse in hand and the same purpose in mind, the two made for Sunken Spire and reached the holding. Thus the first chapter of their journey closed: a knight bound to seek the breadmaker and a turnip farmer who had seen too much, riding toward a town that might hold answers and a daughter named Tresara Ragge.
