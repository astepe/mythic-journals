## Sunken Spire

They began to explore Sunken Spire — a modest town whose lifeblood was fish, the smell of the docks and the trade in the streets. On the outskirts, rising above the wall, stood a large spire painted in bright purple and other vibrant colours; it was impossible to miss.

## Ivan the Malt Knight

They were directed to **Ivan the Malt Knight**, the ruler of Sunken Spire, an eccentric man who had taken it upon himself to paint that spire and leave his mark. He explained that every previous ruler had done the same. **Rekha**, the knight who had ruled before him, had dug a great hole in the middle of the town square and covered it with a thick cloth so that new visitors, not knowing, would step onto it and fall in — not far, but enough to startle them and twist an ankle or two. It was a joke, a legacy; Ivan had managed to avoid the pit himself when he first arrived and was proud of that.

Ivan asked one thing of Igor: pay his respects to Rekha, who was buried in a small graveyard just outside of town, and in return Ivan would tell him where to find a seer. Igor asked about the plague, the fog that choked people in their sleep; Ivan had not heard much of it, perhaps it had touched only smaller settlements and had not yet reached Sunken Spire, but the seer on the island to the east might have answers. Igor agreed. He and Lionel went to the graveyard and paid their respects to Rekha.

Before they went any further, Lionel spoke up — he did not think he could continue on with Igor, not on his mission to discover a cure; he had his turnip farm to tend to and needed to go home. He bid Igor adieu and went on his way.

## Tresara Ragge and the Apothecary

Back in town Igor asked Ivan if he knew anything of **Tresara Ragge**. Ivan did not; she was not well known, a girl from a settlement west of Sunken Spire. If she had come seeking medicines or potions, he said, there was a prominent apothecary in town and Igor could look there. Igor went. Just outside the apothecary a group of commoners had gathered, gossiping in rising panic about a disease, a thing that choked people in their sleep; Igor spoke to them, calmed them, told them he would get to the bottom of it, then stepped inside.

## Gerath the Apothecary

**Gerath** was at his workbench, carefully tending his potions, when Igor came in and called out — *I need your help. Who are you?* — and Gerath started, spilled some of his potions, shattered a vial. He was furious. In time he cooled; he and Igor found a kind of kinship. Gerath had a large ego, did things his way and knew a great deal, and so did Igor. Gerath had not heard of any fog that could do such a thing; he was confused, intrigued. He said that if Igor went out and brought back information about this cloud, he could have one of his potions, and perhaps together they could understand what was happening — and in the back of his mind Gerath liked the idea of discovering a new malady, perhaps naming it after himself. As Igor was leaving, Gerath tried to slip a potion into his pocket; Igor caught him. Gerath had not been subtle. Still Igor took the potion and did not make a fuss. It was an odd moment, and then it was over.

Igor had decided it was time to acquire a squire, someone to help him on his journey. He went to the barracks to look.

## The Barracks

There he found a young man standing beside an older gentleman. The young man was full of himself, the kind who thought he knew a great deal when he was really quite naive; he gave Igor a judgmental look and sneered — *Oh, you think you are some kind of knight?* — unimpressed. The older man spoke up and told the boy to shush. He was **Hygo**: jaded, annoyed, a guard at Sunken Spire for most of his adult life. Igor turned to him and began to speak; before long he had asked whether Hygo would become his squire.

Hygo lit up. He had not been expecting it and had never considered such a thing, but at this point in his life it made a kind of sense. His son had left the realm and gone up to Cobbled Wall to gamble and chase women; Hygo was disappointed in the course his life had taken and felt he could have raised the boy better. He had been lazy, perhaps; he had messed things up. So when the knight asked — *maybe it would be a good idea to become a squire now* — something in him stirred. Maybe he could start anew, go out on adventures; maybe it was not too late. He said yes.

## The Boat

Igor returned to Ivan with his new squire. They needed a boat to reach the island in the east where the seer dwelt; Ivan was generous and lent them one that could be found on the shores near Sunken Spire. Igor and Hygo made for the docks — the air reeked of fish and rotting cod — and, unwilling to set out in the dark, made camp for the night. From the shore they could see the island in the distance, a shape against the sky in the failing light, and from it something like crystalline rays, a faint sparkle on the horizon. A strange place. Tomorrow they would sail for it.

## The Crossing

Igor and Hygo set out in the morning in wet, rainy, muggy air. By the time they reached the island it was still morning, perhaps an hour or two before noon. It took them some time to find a place to put in; at last they came upon an old, abandoned dockyard, tied the boat down and made it fast, then set out to explore and find the seer.

## The River

In their search they came to a river that led out toward the ocean. There, at the riverside, a shepherd was kneeling — gathering water or washing his face, they could not tell — when eight wolf crabs emerged. It was unprecedented: wolf crabs almost always keep to the ocean shore, where they live and spend their time; to find them this far inland at a river was deeply unusual. They encroached from the edges and surrounded him.

Igor burst forward to protect the man. He obliterated one of the crabs, crushing its shell into hundreds of pieces where it stood, and drove another off into the bushes so that it retreated — but it was too little, too late. Three of the wolf crabs attacked in tandem from all sides and tore the shepherd to pieces as he lay by the river, his blood seeping into the stream. The shepherd had never spoken a word to the Salt Knight or to Hygo; there had been no time, and they had never had a chance to meet him or learn his name. They continued their search.

## The Lullaby

Late in the day, into the evening, they began to hear music — a lullaby — somewhere in the distance, and when they looked toward the sound they saw a kind of sheen, an illusory screen, as if the air itself were rippling. They knew that was likely where the seer dwelt, but it was too late to go farther. They made camp there for the night. Thus they closed the second chapter: on the island, with the lullaby in their ears and the memory of the shepherd at the river.
