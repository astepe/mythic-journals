## The Shepherd's Aftermath

Igor awoke by the river with the memory of the shepherd upon him — the crabs, the blood in the stream, the man who had spoken no word. Hygo was already awake, or perhaps had never slept; the squire sat still, staring at nothing. He had never seen a man die in such a manner.

*I shall not let such a thing befall you*, Igor said. Hygo looked upon him with something between gratitude and fear. *Keep me safe. Though I am meant to serve you — I need your protection.* *Such is the duty of a knight*, said Igor. *Of me. The Salt Knight.* *Yes*, said Hygo, faintly. *So you keep saying.*

## The Singing Mushroom

There had been music in the air since the night before — a lullaby, faint and strange, that made the limbs heavy and the eyes want to close, drawing them like a tide. They followed the sound upriver toward the rush of the waterfall; as they drew closer the music did not grow louder but grew more spacious, more echoey, as though the source receded even as they approached. Then they saw it: a mushroom, great, twenty feet tall, its cap red and purple and mottled deep, raining spores into the still air while the lullaby poured from within it. *Such mushrooms grow where I came from*, said Igor. *They taste awful. Not even salt can save them.* Behind the mushroom hung silk — jewelled fabric, glittering lace, layer upon layer — and no body was visible beneath, only the silk swaying and the voice.

## Melisande, the Jewelled Seer

The voice spoke in melody, half-sung, half-whispered. *Who are you?* *It is I*, said Igor. *The Salt Knight.* *A knight on this island*, said the voice, *is a strange sight.* The seer asked to see his jewels; Igor offered a salt crystal from his pack, one of his finest, and the voice knew its history at once — that it had come from the west, taken from a poor old woman. Igor did not deny it. Then the seer made their offer: they held out an emerald and gave their terms — *Carry it north, to the Tattered Tower, far beyond the mountains* — and would not say why. When Igor pressed for the jewel's significance they gave no answer. *You are a knight*, said the silk, still as stone. *You must honour the seers.* Igor accepted the task; in return, Melisande — for that was the name — would answer one question. He asked of the cloud, the suffocating mist that choked people in their sleep: was it the work of evil? The silk stirred, then went very still. *There is no known source of what ails them. Try as you might — protect those you can. The fate of the realm cannot be fully revealed.* It was not much, but it was honest. Before Igor departed, the seer asked one more thing: their pet fox Bedivere was abroad in the wild, a curious creature who liked to witness new things, and if Igor found it in his travels he should guide it and help it along. The music shifted — brighter, quicker — and ushered them out. Hygo stood speechless; he had never seen a seer before. *Was that a seer?* he said. *Yes*, said Igor. *Grow accustomed to it.*

## Salt from the Sky

They turned south to return the boat to Ivan; it was the right thing to do, and Hygo noted it, quietly impressed that Igor chose honour over haste. As they pushed off from shore the rain began — salt water, the drops stinging the skin and crusting on every surface — and behind them Igor watched the animals, boar and deer and wolf crabs, crowding into an abandoned bowery on the coast to shelter from the downpour. Igor tipped his head back and opened his mouth. *Hallelujah*, he said. *It is raining salt water.* Hygo pulled a blanket over himself and said nothing, already reaching into his bag — a bag that held nothing but pills, blood pressure medication; the squire of the Salt Knight had hypertension. *I am very disappointed in this discovery*, said Igor. *The sodium*, Hygo muttered. *Do you have any potassium salt?* Igor sighed. *I shall find you some fake salt. I do not want your heart to explode from the salt I gave you.*

## Return to Sunken Spire

They reached the mainland by afternoon and returned the boat — the *Althea*, as Ivan called it, built by his cousin Pritchard when they were children. Ivan was grateful and in good spirits despite the strange rain. *We have had a salt shortage here*, he told them, *and we have an open fish market. The salt-water rain preserves the fish.* He paused. *The crops, though — the turnips — they are ruined.* Igor could see only the blessing, salt water falling from the heavens, a sign he was on the right path; Hygo, huddled under his hat, could see the disaster. Ivan spoke of Borwenna at Cobbled Wall — worth a visit. They parted warmly. Igor set his face north.

## Bedivere in the Ferns

The salt-water drizzle continued through the afternoon. Stinging ferns lined the ground, coated in a film of brine; everything tasted of the sea. In a clearing among the ferns they found a man and his young son — the man skipping, whistling, a bow slung across his back and a pointy leather cap on his head. His name was Davith, the boy was Gareth, and they were following a fox through the woods. Davith had thought the encroaching fog that choked people in their sleep was all a hoax. The fox sat in a tree, ten feet up, smiling. Igor recognized it at once. *Bedivere.* The fox's ears twitched at the name; its body remained still, grinning. Davith grew serious and leaned in close. *This fox*, he said, *is a harbinger of death. I am sure of it.* He told them of his family dog Winston in its final hours — how the fox had appeared inside their home, the doors all shut, sitting on the kitchen table and smiling, watching as the old dog breathed its last, and when Winston was gone the fox was gone. *It only wants to witness*, said Igor. *But why death?* said Davith; his hands were shaking, the fox was watching him. *He is looking at me. Can you not see?* Davith collapsed — hit the ground hard, unconscious, breath shallow, eyes rolling — and Gareth screamed for his father. Igor steadied the boy. *Where is home?* Gareth pointed west.

## Camp with the Fallen

They could not travel far; night was falling. Igor made camp and tended to Davith, who drifted in and out of consciousness through the evening until at last he came around enough to sip tea. *I think my obsession is unhealthy*, Davith admitted. *Get a better hobby*, said Igor. The fox was gone; it had slipped away while they were focused on Davith. By morning Davith was strong enough to travel. He gathered Gareth close, straightened his back, and thanked Igor. He had heard from Lionel, who had passed through, of his encounters with the salt knight; he mentioned it. *Whatever bad words Lionel used to describe me*, said Igor, *they are not true.* *I will not forget what happened today. I will tell all those I know of the great Igor — the kindly Igor.* *You are certainly dynamic*, said Davith. *Enigmatic.* They parted at dawn. Igor's last words: *Salt your food. Embrace the flavour.*

## The Taunting Voices

Igor and Hygo pressed north along the river. The salt-water drizzle continued, relentless; Hygo was going through his medication at an alarming rate. Then the voices began — from all directions, mocking, jeering, layered over each other like a crowd. *Who do you think you are?* *You think you are some kind of knight, idiot?* *Look at this fool. What is he carrying — salt?* *The oaths are meaningless.* Figures shimmered at the edges of sight, blending into the trees and ferns like mirages; to move made it worse, every step amplifying the chorus until it drowned out the rain, the footsteps, everything. Hygo was breaking. *They tell me I should not have smoked all those years. They mock my pill bag. I cannot go forward.* *These are lies*, said Igor. *They mean to tear us down. It will not work.* But when they stood still the voices faded, so they stopped; Igor shared water from his ever-flask — frosted glass, never empty — and they waited. By nightfall the voices had subsided. The hex was quiet again, but marked in their memory; Igor would not return to this place willingly. They made camp at the forest's edge. The salt-water rain eased at last to a whisper. The road north lay still before them.
