## Holdings

### Sunken Spire

A coastal town known for its fishing and modest market. The spire itself is marked by unusual colours; trade is small here, but the open fish market is the lifeblood of the settlement. The recent salt-water rain has been a mixed blessing — it preserves the fish but is destroying the turnip crops.

**Ruler:** Ivan the Malt Knight

**Known Trouble:** Salt-water rain damaging crops; a general salt shortage (now ironically alleviated by the weather); turnips in danger.

### Cobbled Wall

A holding to the north of Sunken Spire, which Ivan mentioned as the seat of a knight named Borwenna. The company has not yet visited.

**Ruler:** Borwenna, Knight at Cobbled Wall

**Known Trouble:** Unknown.

## Seers

### Melisande, the Jewelled Seer

**Sanctum:** A massive red-and-purple mushroom on an island upriver from the coast, near a waterfall; music — a lullaby — emanates from the mushroom itself.

Melisande is hidden beneath layers of jewelled silk and glittering lace; no body is visible. They speak in a melodic, half-sung voice and can see the history of jewelled items brought before them. They tasked Igor with delivering an emerald to the Tattered Tower in the far north, beyond the snowy mountains; in return they answered one question, though the answer about the suffocating cloud was cryptic and grim. They also asked Igor to look after their pet fox Bedivere, a curious creature who wanders the realm.

## Loose Threads

- **The Tattered Tower:** Melisande's emerald must be delivered to a tower in the far north, beyond the snowy mountains; it is said to be difficult to find.
- **Bedivere the Fox:** The Jewelled Seer's pet, a fox that appears to witness death — seen watching Davith and his son, then vanished. Davith believes it is a harbinger; Igor is oath-bound to help it.
- **The Suffocating Cloud:** People are choked in their sleep by some kind of mist; no known source. Melisande says it cannot be stopped, only endured.
- **The Salt-Water Rain:** Salt water has been falling across the realm, preserving fish but killing crops; its cause is unknown.
- **The Invasive Apples:** One named Goyon is connected to apple bushes that spread across the land; Lionel knows more. Davith's son loves the apples; others burn the bushes.
- **Seek the Breadmaker:** A note in Igor's belongings; origin and meaning unknown.
- **Borwenna at Cobbled Wall:** Ivan suggested Igor visit her; purpose unknown.
- **The Shepherd's Death:** A shepherd was killed by wolf crabs far from the beach — unprecedented behaviour. Why were the crabs inland?
