## Igor the Salt Knight

Igor the Salt Knight arrived in Braeburn by boat from a distant land where giant mushrooms grow in such abundance they have become a nuisance. He does not speak much of his origins — only that he was dropped off like a child to school — but he carries the manners and obsessions of somewhere else entirely.

He is bombastic, proud, and utterly devoted to salt: he seasons everything to excess, throws salt over his shoulder as superstition demands (and onto anyone standing behind him), and views the recent salt-water rain as a divine endorsement of his path. He carries salt crystals in his pack, some of dubious provenance, and considers flavour a moral imperative. Beneath the bluster he takes his knightly oaths seriously — he returned a borrowed boat when he could have kept it, tended a stranger who collapsed in the road, and refuses to judge a creature until it has done wrong. His ego is vast but it sits alongside a genuine, if sometimes clumsy, sense of duty. He cannot read for pleasure though he learned enough letters to earn his knighthood; he does not laugh often, and when asked why he says the weight of the world is on his shoulders. He has been oath-bound by the Jewelled Seer Melisande to deliver an emerald to the Tattered Tower in the far north, beyond the mountains.

**Weapon:** Sword and shield.

**Notable Gear:** An ever-flask of frosted glass containing an endless supply of fresh water; a pouch of salt crystals.

## Hygo the Squire

Hygo is Igor's squire — a gruff man in his mid to late forties, anxious and entirely unprepared for the road. He was born and raised in Sunken Spire and served as a guard there for most of his adult life, never leaving until Igor took him on. His son left the realm and went up to Cobbled Wall to gamble and chase women; Hygo was disappointed in how his own life had gone and felt he could have raised the boy better. He had been lazy, he thought; he had messed things up. When Igor asked him at the barracks to become his squire, Hygo said yes — maybe he could start anew. Perhaps it was a midlife crisis, or perhaps it was hope. Whatever the reason, every new horror leaves him flabbergasted and every strange sight widens his eyes further.

He has hypertension, managed by a bag of pills prescribed by someone named Gaurath. The bag is enormous — it is, in fact, the only thing he carries — and he worries constantly about running out. The salt-water rain is a personal catastrophe for him, and Igor's relentless seasoning of every meal is a quiet ordeal he is too polite to refuse. Despite his frailty and his nerves Hygo is loyal; he watches Igor carefully and takes notes on what it means to be a knight. He was shaken badly by the taunting voices in the forest, which mocked his smoking, his medication, his choices, but he pushed through with Igor's encouragement. He is smarter than he looks. He asked Igor if he read philosophy. Igor does not.
